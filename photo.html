<p>I am working as a Senior Bioinformatician in Integrative Analysis at the COVID-19 Multi-omics Blood ATlas (COMBAT) consortium at the University of Oxford using multi-omics techniques in combination with the cutting-edge bioinformatic approaches and statistical methods to explore the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and stratification of patients as well as inform the treatment strategy based on genomics information.</p>

<p>I hold a B.Sc degree in mathematics from the Shandong University (2006) and a Ph.D degree in bioinformatics from Beijing Institute of Genomics (BIG), Chinese Academy of Science (2011). After graduation, I was appointed as Assistant Professor and Associate Professor in the same institute (2011-2014). During my time in Beijing, I was focusing on the study of genome evolution by means of a large set of genomes from myriad species that span a diversity of taxonomies.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I moved to UK and accepted an appointment as a Research Associate at the Cancer Institute at the University College London for nearly two years (2014-2016) where I endeavored to construct several decent comprehensive pipelines for RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analyses with their applications on cancer research such as Leukemia study.</p>

<p>After leaving London, I spent two years at Oxford (2016-2018) as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of Oxford where I was working on conducting RNA-Seq analysis to study the mechasims of various groups of Conifer species in response to drought stress in terms of gene expression profiling and sequence variations.</p>

<p>Prior to taking up my current role, I was employed as a Senior Bioinformatics Research Officer at the LeedsOmics at the University of Leeds where my primary responsibility was to maintain the day-to-day running of LeedsOmics Institute, organise and coordinate LeedsOmics activities such as annual symposiums, research seminar series, training workshops and coding clubs as well as provide the data analysis and training for the researchers in terms of bioinformatics and other cutting-edge omics technologies.</p>

<p>I am serving on the Editorial Boards of BMC Genomic Data, BMC Research Notes, Gene, PeerJ, Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, Scientific Reports, Evolutionary Bioinformatics, Frontiers in Genetics and PLOS ONE. I am a member of Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, Genetics Society, Royal Society of Biology and Biochemical Society.</p>
